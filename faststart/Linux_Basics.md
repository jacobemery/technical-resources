**Welcome to LinuxONE**

This Fast Start Guide is designed to provide critical Linux environment
information available to those relatively new to Linux.

The lab assumes registration to the LinuxONE Community Cloud, successful
deployment of a linux server and you are able to login via ssh client.  
[Click here if you need help with that](deploy-virtual-server.md)

From a ssh shell prompt, this lab suggests and briefly explains a few linux
commands that are fundamental to using linux.

The ssh linux shell prompt in the lab instruction appears as follows:

**[linux1]\$** 

Actual ssh Linux shell prompt will look slightly different.

Linux cat command displays the content of a unix file to the terminal.  

**[linux1]\$ cat /etc/\*-release**

/etc/\*-release contains information about
the installed Linux distribution. This information is very significant and will
be explained later in these lab instructions.

**[linux1]\$ cat /proc/version**

/proc/version contains additional information
about the Linux kernel and GCC compiler associated with the Linux distribution

**[linux1]\$ cat /proc/sysinfo** 

/proc/sysinfo contains information about the
hardware and virtualization hypervisor hosting this Linux.

Like the Linux distribution release, this information is very significant and
will be explained later in these lab instructions.

However, with the ‘cat” command, the information streams past without the user being able to read it.  While some terminals provide the ability to scroll, there are several ways to hold data from the file on the screen until ready to view more. One of those commands is 'more’, where space bar will display the next page and enter will display only the next line of the data.

**[linux1]\$ more /proc/sysinfo**

Alternate method makes use of pipe which is the vertical bar. A pipe ( \| ) is
passes output from the left of the pipe symbol to the command on the right of
the pipe symbol.

**[linux1]\$ cat /proc/sysinfo \| more**

The following writes the output to a unix file

**[linux1]\$ cat /proc/sysinfo \> sysinfo.txt**

The \> symbol is known as a redirection. The output is being redirected from the
terminal display to file sysinfo.txt

**[linux1]\$ ls** 

The ls command will display file names in the current file
directory

**[linux1]\$ pwd** 

The pwd command will display the current present working
directory where ls command listed files names.

Assuming sysinfo.txt was created in the present working directory, then the
following command using \>\> will append data to the sysinfo.txt (note make sure
there are no spaces between \>\> below) 

**[linux1]\$ cat /etc/\*-release \>\> sysinfo.txt**

sysinfo.txt now contains output from /proc/sysinfo followed by output from /etc/\*-release

While it is possible to display the entire sysinfo.txt, the following commands
will display a few lines at the beginning of the file (head), then display a few
lines at the end of the file (tail).

**[linux1]\$ head sysinfo.txt**

**[linux1]\$ tail sysinfo.txt**

The following will rename the file. A rename is accomplished with mv (move)
command. 

**[linux1]\$ mv sysinfo.txt sysinfo.listing**

The following will delete or remove (rm) the file

**[linux1]\$ rm sysinfo.listing**

The linux command set is very rich. A few suggested ways to learn about all the
available commands is to enter one or more letters at the shell prompt, then tab
key twice. 

**[linux1]\$ ls \<tab> \<tab>**

The output lists all the Linux commands that begin with ls The output has many
more Linux commands beyond ls This quick tip of entering one or more letters
followed by is very handy to achieving advanced level knowledge of Linux.

**[linux1]\$ man lscpu**

The above man command provides manual pages about a specific command. In this
case, manual pages for the lscpu command are displayed. Again, enter key will
advance 1 line at a time , space bar will advance 1 page at a time, and q would
quit returning control to the ssh shell prompt 

**[linux1]\# lscpu**

The man pages explain how the lscpu displays information about the CPU architecture. Is that
BogoMIPS value for real? Try the same command on a different hardware architecture as a comparison. 
The architecture of LinuxONE hardware has technology only available in this server. 
Bottom line - this architecture is made to host thousands of Linux images running concurrently where the network
delay between Linux images is near zero. Use the man command to learn the
purpose for each of the suggested Linux fundamental commands that follow.

**[linux1]\$ df**

**[linux1]\$ ps**

**[linux1]\$ ps -ef \| more**

**[linux1]\$ ls -al \| more**

**[linux1]\$ cd /**

**[linux1]\$ pwd**

**[linux1]\$ ls -al \| more** 

**[linux1]\$ cd \~**

**[linux1]\$ ls -al \| more**

**[linux1]\$ id**

**[linux1]\$ env \| more [linux1]\$ echo \$ PATH**

**[linux1]\$ echo 'a test stream of data' \> testfile**

**[linux1]\$ cat testfile**

**[linux1]\$ echo 'a second test stream of data' \>\> testfile**

**[linux1]\$ cat testfile**

**[linux1]\$ rm testfile**

**[linux1]\$ date**

**[linux1]\$ cal 9 1752**

September 1752 is missing 11 days. An internet search will explain why. It is an
interesting piece of history.

**[linux1]\$ man cal** … also discusses 1752

**[linux1]\$ date +%s**

Now do the same command

**[linux1]\$ date +%s**

Observe number incremented The above command displays a 10 digit unix time, aka
Epoch time, aka POSIX time. Enter the 10 digit number immediately following the
\@ below (2 dashes precede 'date \@')

**[linux1]\$ date —date \@**

Now try the following command to get the date this clock began ticking

**[linux1]\$ date —date 0**

This date represents the beginning of unix epoch time This date output is based
on the system time zone which is relative to GMT midnight of 1970. In computer
language, when an event is scheduled for @1600000000, it is possible to use the
date command to convert that to week day, month, day, time, and year.

**[linux1]\$ time**

Output of time command may not be what was expected. So, what good is the time
command. Time in front of any other command, shell script, or program execution
will output system time consumed to complete the command, shell script, or
program. 
**[linux1]\$ time cat /proc/sysinfo**

**[linux1]\$ man time**    ..To understand the purpose of the time command   

**[linux1]\$ echo \$SHELL**

While different shells exist, bash shell is typically used by Linux
distributions. Want to learn about the richness of bash shell?

What is the status of modules in the Linux Kernel?

**[linux1]\$ lsmod**

Investigating a few utilities to monitor real time usage

**[linux1]\$ top**

Cntl-c or q to break out of it.

Stats virtual memory

**[linux1]\$ vmstat**

Stats about network

**[linux1]\$ netstat**

Next commands require root authority

**[linux1]\$ sudo su -**

The kernel-resident network interface is eth0

**[linux1]\$ ifconfig**

Exploring the details of how TCP/IP works

**[linux1]\$ ss -l**

**[linux1]\$ ss -o state established**

**[linux1]\$ ss -s**

**[linux1]\$ ifstat**

Best practice is to only be root when needed because it has the authority to
accidentally mess up the environment. Exit will terminate root authority and
return to user authority environment.

**[linux1]\$ exit**

OK - out of root authority

What packages are available in this Linux distribution? Query all packages

**[linux1]\$ rpm -qa \| more** 

RPM is a powerful Package Manager, which can be
used to build, install, query, verify, update, and erase individual software
packages. An entire lab is needed to explore RPM.

**[linux1]\$ java -version**

If the output of the above command shows java not found, then java needs to be
installed.

What if one or more software packages are needed on the Linux distribution for a
project to build the next big thing? Popular packages include java, node.js,
Apache, spark, vsftpd, mongoDB, PostgreSQL, Apache Web Server, MySQL, Perl, PHP,
Python – and many more

Knowledge of the Linux hardware and software distribution is needed to install
software packages.

Key things to know: Packages compiled to be installed on LinuxONE or Linux on z
will have s390x in the package name.

Packages compiled to be installed on a 64 bit capable intel PC will have x86_64
in the package name.

Linux is a standard that has an accepted Linux kernel used by all. Linux
distributors, Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, etc. all use a standard Linux kernel.
However, each Linux distributor includes “value add” scripts and system
utilities. The Linux distributor “value add” system utilities are different.
An example is the Linux distributor utilities to manage packages 

Red Hat – man yum or internet search for yum
SUSE – man zypper or internet search for zypper

An entire lab is needed to explore each Linux distribution utility to install,
update, remove software, manage repositories, perform various queries, and more.
Learning to use these utilities is pretty easy.

What is the hardware platform?

**[linux1]\$ lscpu**

**[linux1]\$ more /proc/sysinfo**

What is the Linux distribution?

**[linux1]\$ cat /etc/\*-release**

The other way of making software available is to compile from source code. And
again, this is yet another lab. Another significant Linux administration task
requiring full awareness is the firewall. Most Linux distributions are shipped
with very restrictive firewall rules. This can get in the way of development
progress in some cases.

**[linux1]\$ sudo su -**

**[linux1]\$ iptables -L -n -v**

**[linux1]\$ iptables -S**

**[linux1]\$ iptables -h**

**[linux1]\$ exit**

If uncertain how to work with the firewall, (yet another lab needed), then
firewall can be disabled to get something done, such as ftp data, then enable
firewall when done. The Linux distribution procedure to stop and start firewall
varies among the Linux distribution and Linux releases of individual
distributions.

Examples: Red Hat

**[linux1]\$ service iptables status**

**[linux1]\$ service iptables stop**

**[linux1]\$ service iptables status**

**[linux1]\$ service iptables start**

Want to see all the linux kernel parameters ?

**[linux1]\$ sudo su**

**[linux1]\$ sysctl -a**

**[linux1]\$ exit**

...get out of root

A command of the Linux basics will really make things fun. The internet is
loaded with linux information.
